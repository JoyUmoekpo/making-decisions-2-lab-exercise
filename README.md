# Making Decisions 2 Lab
In this exercise you will practice working with more complex conditionals, loops, and arrays.

## Instructions
To start, download the exercise content for today.

Once you have done that, use the command line to navigate into the folder and initialize a git repository. As you move through todays lab (and especially once you have completed it), make sure to commit and push your changes.

Open the `makingDecisions2Lab.js` file, and attempt as many problems as you can.

The goal is to get through all of the starting questions, and then as many of the intermediate and advanced questions as possible. If you get through the intermediate questions, challenge yourself with the advanced questions. The advanced questions will cover topics not taught in class. This is intentional. Use resources online to help you figure out the solutions.

Make sure to push your completed code to GitHub.
